              <p>Water Life is a 3D view-based application that allows a user to roam free in the open world of the underground sea using basic controls to do so. The project is meant
                to display many aspects, such as 3D models, coding, implementation, CGI implementation, and a flocking system. When users play with the project
                they experience that open-world 3D experience. This project was created by a group and as part of my contribution, I created the skybox,
                some 3D models, the scripting, and the flocking system. Click <a

              <p>Walking Simulation is a project that displayed the overall concept of what is known as a walking sim. This project has three types of
                styles a user can click and view the generative art piece form. This piece uses unique forms of art to display a walking sim which 
                is functioning based on the code I implemented. This project was created by myself to test my ability to not only code but to code a 
                visual art experience that the user can enjoy. Click <a
